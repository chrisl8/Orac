TODO:
1. Monitor count of 'espeak' or 'aplay' processes "stuck" and reboot if there are some.
2. Notify if car doors are not locked.
3. Notify if lights are on or doors open after a certain time of day.
3. Enable finding items by searching obsidian documents.
4. IF it loses track of me sometimes, use devices (like car) to override current isHome status when received, if they are far away.

Alert me when my watch is fully charged, so I can put it back on.

Check if:
 - Watch is not fully or almost fully charged
 - and I haven't charged it today
 - and I appear to be in my office
   - Not known to be away from home and
   - Motion sensor recent
   - Lights on in office
 - then alert me to charge my watch.

Some events happen on HA. It has its own "automations" but I find them clunky,
but could I have HA essentially CALL this API instead of polling a LOT?
Or should I just poll A LOT?

If the wall switch in the office is turned off:
1. Turn off all office lights.
2. Turn the wall switch back on. ;)

When watch is 100% charged, alert me to put it back on.
battery_status: 'Charged',
battery: 100,


Things HA is doing by itself already:
Turn on office lights when Office motion happens.

# Pi Setup

## Raspberry Pi Install and Configuration
 - Use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to install Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)
   - If you want to, you can use the Config icon (gear) to customize some things:
     - Set host name to `Orac`
     - Enable SSH
       - Add your Key if you want to
     - Set up my username/password
   - and boot it up, no need to edit anything on the config before first boot
 - Initial boot
   - If you set things up above, it should just boot right into xWindows with no password prompt
 - Configuration
   - SSH In and
     - Install my dotfiles setup, reboot, updateAllTheThings.sh, and reboot
     - Run `sudo raspi-config` (Note: There is a GUI version of this, but it seems to be missing several options.)
         - Interface Options
             - Enable I2C (https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing)
                 - This should allow the LEDs on top to be used.
                 - I'm not using ANy other hardware on this board (no fan, no touchscreen, no camera, no microphone, no speaker)

## Set up Orac on this Devices

Use `syncOrac.sh` to sync code to Pi
```
cd ~/Orac/
./setupAndUpdate.sh
```

Reboot and everything should work.

---

## Auto Login
If the auto-login to GUI quits on you, run `sudo raspi-config` and turn the Auto Login OFF and ON again and reboot, and it will fix it.
System Options->Boot / Auto Login

DO NOT DO STUFF BELOW HERE
It is just for reference

# Old Setup Info
This is old junk from when I was trying to use all of the hardware on the Mycroft Dev Kit, but it was not reliable.

 - Run `sudo raspi-config` (Note: There is a GUI version of this, but it seems to be missing several options.)
   - System Options
     - Wireless LAN - Set to US so it can work (although I'm not using it) 
       - Then Cancel when asked for an SSID
     - Set your host name to `Orac` (If you did not already)
   - Display Options
     - Disable Screen Blanking (If you like, I do)
   - Interface Options
     - Enable SSH (If you did not already)
     - Enable SPI (https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing)
     - Enable I2C (https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing)
       - One of the two, SPI and/or I2C, makes the touchscreen work, both in `evtest` and in X Windows.
 - NOTE: You do **not** need to enable Legacy Camera Mode, and **should not**. It is only required for old Python scripts, such as Mycroft.
- Install Dotfiles per Readme instructions and also run updateAllTheThings.sh and reboot.

### Fix up boot config
Run `diff ~/Orac/pi/boot/config.txt /boot/config.txt` to see what you need to tweak,  
then edit or replace `/boot/config.txt` and reboot.

Replace command:
`sudo cp /home/chrisl8/Orac/pi/boot/config.txt /boot/config.txt`

### Install audio drivers and libraries
See further down for full information. This is the "quick start"

```
cd
pip install smbus2
sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers espeak
gh repo clone OpenVoiceOS/VocalFusionDriver
cd VocalFusionDriver
sudo cp xvf3510.dtbo /boot/overlays
cd driver
make all
sudo mkdir /lib/modules/6.1.21-v8+/kernel/drivers/vocalfusion
sudo cp vocalfusion* /lib/modules/6.1.21-v8+/kernel/drivers/vocalfusion
sudo depmod 6.1.21-v8+ -a
```

### Make Orac run on startup, but from GUI so Audio works
**Note: If a user autostart file exists at /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi, then the System autostart file is totally ignored (for that user).**
Reference: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=294014
```
mkdir -p ${HOME}/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi
cp /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart ${HOME}/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/
vi ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
```
and add this at the bottom:
`@/home/chrisl8/Orac/startpm2.sh`
OR if you want the terminal to open and see it:
`@lxterminal -e bash /home/chrisl8/Orac/startpm2.sh`

If it isn't already done, add: `pm2 log` to the bottom of `startpm2.sh` to prevent if from just shutting down immediately.

# Hardware Information and Reference

## SJ201 Information

### SJ201 Board
The board on the top of the Mark II dev kit is called the SJ201.

Hardware Information
https://github.com/MycroftAI/hardware-mycroft-mark-II/blob/master/mark-II-Rpi-devkit/KiCAD/SJ201-Raspberry%20Pi%204%20Daughterboard/README.md

The primary information about it is here:
https://github.com/MycroftAI/hardware-mycroft-mark-II
but there is a more thorough testing suite that should help guide how to connect to all the features here:
https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing

### Verify SJ201 board exists and find version

References:
https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing/blob/main/init_hardware.sh
https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing/blob/main/hardware_tests/auto_detect_sj201.py

View all `i2c` devices:
```
❯ sudo i2cdetect -a -y 1
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
00: -- -- -- -- 04 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
10: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
20: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2f
30: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
40: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
50: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
60: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 6d -- --
70: -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
```

tiny_address = "04"
xmos_address = "2c"
ti_address = "2f"

"Old" SJ201 have "04" (tiny)
The documentation says they have "all 3" but the "2c" (xmos) seems to go away sometimes, and the presence of the "tiny" is the key to knowing this is an "old" or V1 SJ201.

View all `spi` devices:
```
❯ ls -l /dev/spidev*
crw-rw---- 1 root spi 153, 0 Feb 28 19:41 /dev/spidev0.0
crw-rw---- 1 root spi 153, 1 Feb 28 19:41 /dev/spidev0.1
```

## Fan
Reference: https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing/blob/main/hardware_tests/old_fan.py

Hardware speed range is appx 30-255.
`sudo i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 101 0 i # Stop`
`sudo i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 101 255 i # Full speed`

For some reason we always need `-a` to see 04 both with `i2cdetect` and `i2cset`

## Touchscreen
Turning on SPI and/or I2C (not sure which) should have allowed touchscreen to work.

 - Test it in xWindows, and it should work.
   - Try opening Menus
   - Try inside web browser
     - Both should work

### Touchscreen from Terminal
- Install `evtest` and test touchscreen
    - `sudo apt intall evtest`
        - Reference: https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing/blob/main/init_hardware.sh
    - Run:
      `sudo evtest`
    - and, device `event0` should look like this:
        - Reference: https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing/blob/main/utils/async_touch.py
```
/dev/input/event0:      raspberrypi-ts
```
- Note that if set up correctly, that is the ONLY device listed apart from possibly any keyboard/mouse you connected.
    - While without SPI or I2C turned on, you will see an array of devices for some reason, none of which really do anything.
- Select it, and tap on the screen, and it should output all sorts of fun data about touch/release events!
    - It does multi-finger-tracking, etc.

I'm not sure yet if I'll try to like display an image and track touches on their own (as Mycroft did),  
or try to use a web browser interface and use the browser touch input.
For now, just know it works.

## LED Ring on top
Reference: https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing/blob/main/hardware_tests/ledtest_old.py

Use i2cset to set all LEDs to white:
```
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 0 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 1 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 2 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 3 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 4 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 5 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 6 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 7 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 8 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 9 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 10 250 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 11 250 250 250 i
```

Use i2cset to set all LEDs to red:
```
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 0 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 1 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 2 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 3 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 4 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 5 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 6 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 7 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 8 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 9 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 10 250 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 11 250 0 0 i
```

Use i2cset to set all LEDs to green:
```
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 0 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 1 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 2 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 3 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 4 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 5 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 6 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 7 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 8 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 9 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 10 0 250 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 11 0 250 0 i
```

Use i2cset to set all LEDs to blue:
```
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 0 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 1 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 2 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 3 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 4 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 5 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 6 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 7 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 8 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 9 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 10 0 250 250 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 11 0 250 250 i
```

Use i2cset to turn all LEDs off:
```
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 0 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 1 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 2 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 3 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 4 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 5 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 6 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 7 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 8 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 9 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 10 0 0 0 i
i2cset -a -y 1 0x04 11 0 0 0 i
```

## Switch
Reference: https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing/blob/main/utils/async_button.py
`raspi-gpio get 25`

You can flip the switch back and forth and alternate between:
`GPIO 25: level=0 fsel=0 func=INPUT pull=DOWN`
and
`GPIO 25: level=1 fsel=0 func=INPUT pull=DOWN`

## Buttons
References:
 - https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing/blob/main/utils/async_button.py
 - https://github.com/MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing/blob/main/hardware_tests/test_markii.py

- Right Button (S1): 22
  `raspi-gpio get 22`
  Result: `GPIO 22: level=1 fsel=0 func=INPUT pull=DOWN`
  Hold down the "Activate" button and run it again and level should be 0.

- Middle Button (S2): 23
`raspi-gpio get 23`
Result: `GPIO 23: level=1 fsel=0 func=INPUT pull=DOWN`
Hold down the "Activate" button and run it again and level should be 0.

 - Activate Button (Center of LED Ring): 24
`raspi-gpio get 24`
Result: `GPIO 24: level=1 fsel=0 func=INPUT pull=DOWN`
Hold down the "Activate" button and run it again and level should be 0.

## Camera
Reference: https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/use-raspberry-pi-camera-with-bullseye

In X Windows run:  
`libcamera-hello`
 - You can run this via SSH, but you won't see the output!
It should open a screen and show you the output from the camera as a video, while streaming data about the images to the terminal.
 - If you want to have it stay open indefinitely, run `libcamera-hello -t 0`

To take a picture and save it run:  
`libcamera-jpeg -o test.jpg`

## Speaker

Things I've tried:

Note: The "bcm2835" is the Raspberry Pi onboard chip (Broadcom), so if you see that audio devices, it is NOT the SJ201 speakers.

`sudo vi /boot/config.txt`
UN-comment the line
```
dtparam=i2s=on
```
COMMENT the line:
```
#dtparam=audio=on
```
In other words turn on i2s and turn off the default audio device
and reboot.

# Old Information


### Grab the Mycroft test code in case you need it
```
cd
git clone git@github.com:MycroftAI/mark-ii-hardware-testing.git
```

## Possible audio helps from Mycroft code:
NOTE: I'm not 100% sure whether the above is all I need,  
as I also edited init_hardware.sh to change /home/pi/venv to /home/chrisl8/venv  
and then ran:
```
cd ${HOME}/mark-ii-hardware-testing
init_hardware.sh
```
and rebooted.

You may have to run this on every boot?
```
cd ${HOME}/mark-ii-hardware-testing

# Mycroft Dev Kit on OpenVoice Operating System
Getting all the hardware to work on a bare installation of Raspberry Pi OS wasn't working,
so I tried this OVOS image that runs on the Mycroft Dev Kit and everything works!

This seems to be the way it is released:
https://community.mycroft.ai/t/openvoiceos-a-bare-minimal-production-type-of-os-based-on-buildroot/4708/414?page=21

I downloaded this image:
OpenVoiceOS_rpi4_64-gui_dev-202301171328.img
on
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PUtNXfZ5jMUlVAgyN-KXPdVdX6r51eBw/view?usp=share_link
on March 3 and installed it.

I think that you can also get the images from the links here:
https://openvoiceos.github.io/community-docs/getting_image/

Documentation for OpenVoiceOS is here:
https://openvoiceos.com/

Install image using the Raspberry Pi Imager.

I plugged into Ethernet, so it didn't ask about Wi-Fi or network setup.

Select "No Backend"

Once it boots up, reboot right away because the first time it starts MyCroft twice, causing everything to be VERY SLOW.

Use the menu system to enable SSH.
Default credentials 'mycroft/mycroft'

Rename it:
`sudo vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/hostname.service`
Comment out existing hostnamectl command and replace it with one to name it Orac:
```
#ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "hostnamectl set-hostname OpenVoiceOS-`sed 's/://g' /sys/class/net/eth0/address | tail -c 7`"
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "hostnamectl set-hostname Orac"
```
and reboot of course.

See if it will run Orac:
 - Install node

cd
mkdir bin
cd bin
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v19.7.0/node-v19.7.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
tar xvf node-v19.7.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
rm node-v19.7.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
ln -s node-v19.7.0-linux-arm64 node

Add this to .bashrc:
export PATH=${HOME}/bin:${HOME}/bin/node/bin:${PATH}

Exit and reconnect:
node -v

 - Copy unison over so that we can sync it

scp dotfiles/pi64/unison* mycroft@orac:./bin/

 I cannot find any way to add a new path to the pre-login connection, so link to this file from the
default /usr/bin path

sudo ln -s /home/mycroft/bin/unison /usr/bin/

Make sure that the IP address in syncOrac.sh is correct, and run:

syncOrac.sh

 - Run Orac

cd Orac/node
npm i
node server.js

 - Make it run as a "service"
npm i -g pm2

   - Systemd
     - https://www.unixsysadmin.com/systemd-user-services/
     - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd

enough to do that itself, but if not, we could ask it to.

# Trying the "Manjaro" OpenVoice Operating System (OVOS) instead of the Buildroot based image
https://community.mycroft.ai/t/openvoiceos-a-bare-minimal-production-type-of-os-based-on-buildroot/4708/440?u=chrisl8

This is an Arch based image, but a FULL Linux install, rather than the "Buildroot" thingy, so it should be nicer for me to 

Download latest Manjaro-based image from:
https://downloads.openvoiceos.com/images/manjaro/stable/

I'm using "mark2" edition, assuming that means/includes the Dev Kit. This is the download link I used:
https://downloads.openvoiceos.com/images/manjaro/stable/

 - Install image using the Raspberry Pi Imager.
   - Note that it requires at least a 32GB card. 16GB is too small and will appear to just fail to image the card.
 - Insert SD Card and boot up. 
   - I plugged into Ethernet, so it didn't ask about Wi-Fi or network setup.
 - Select "No Backend"
 - Use Default Speech Engines

Swipe from top down to see menu for
 - Brightness
 - Volume
 - Home, Wifi, Rotation, Microphone, Settings, Restart, Reboot

 - Do an initial reboot of the system to ensure everything is working.
   - I found that my initial settings didn't stick after the first reboot, but they did after the second.

 - Use settings to customize system
   - Customize -> Pick the color you like
   - Use About to find the IP Address
Note that SSH is already enabled by default, so there is no need to enable it in the config menu.

## Connect via SSH
https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/manjaro/#core_configuration

You can initially SSH in as EITHER `ovos` or `root` and the password is `ovos` in both cases.
`ssh ovos@192.168.1.157`
or
`ssh root@192.168.1.157`

## Display info during boot
edit `/boot/cmdline.txt`
Remove the words `quiet splash`

## Fix-ups

shadow.service won't start until these exist:
```
sudo mkdir /home/pulse
sudo mkdir /home/pulse-access
```

Mycroft likes this to exist, although it never gets used:
`sudo mkdir /var/log/mycroft`

## Force a fsck check:
`shutdown -Fr now`
The `-F` forces a check disk.

## Use Gparted to expand the filesystem.

## If it is broken when you restart
This is what finally worked to put it back into a working state:
Log in as root.
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-image-arch-recipe/
cd ovos-image-arch-recipe/docker_overlay/scripts
chmod +x run_scripts_mark2.sh
./run_scripts_mark2.sh
shutdown -r now
```
And it seems good again!

## System
Use `systemctl` to see if everything is working or not.

### Logs
To see what is going on run:
`journalctl --user -f`

## Set up my Public Key
```
sudo pacman -S vim
mkdir .ssh
vim .ssh/authorized_keys
```
Insert SSH Public key
```
chmod go-rwx -R .ssh
```

Test Public Key login and if it works then
`sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config`
and set
```
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
PermitRootLogin no
```
and also set a strong password for yourself and root

## Rename System

`hostnamectl set-hostname orac`
Reboot

## Install Node.js

I'm trying this as the user ovos for now.

```
cd
mkdir bin
cd bin
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v19.9.0/node-v19.9.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
tar xvf node-v19.9.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
rm node-v19.9.0-linux-arm64.tar.xz
ln -s node-v19.9.0-linux-arm64 node
```

Add this to the very top of .bash_profile:  
`export PATH=${HOME}/bin:${HOME}/bin/node/bin:${PATH}`

Exit and reconnect:
`node -v`

## Profile

Move any `.bashrc` files to `.bash_profile`, which is the correct filename.

## Sync Orac to Device and Setup

From Remote
`scp dotfiles/pi64/unison* ovos@192.168.1.157:./bin/`

On Orac
`sudo cp /home/ovos/bin/unison* /usr/local/sbin/`

From Remote again
`syncOrac.sh`

On Orac
```
cd Orac/node
npm i
node server.js
```

Make it run automatically,
`npm i -g pm2`

as a Service

- Systemd
    - https://www.unixsysadmin.com/systemd-user-services/
    - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd

```
mkdir -p .config/systemd/user
vim .config/systemd/user/orac.service
```

```
[Unit]
Description=Orac Server
Wants=default.target
After=default.target

[Service]
Type=forking
PIDFile=/home/ovos/.pm2/pm2.pid
ExecStart=/home/ovos/Orac/startpm2.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

NOTE: We did NOT ask systemd to ever restart pm2. The assumption is that pm2 is smart
enough to do that itself, but if not, we could ask it to.

```
systemctl --user daemon-reload # To allow systemd to see the service exists
systemctl --user status orac
systemctl --user start orac
```

And to make it start at boot:
`systemctl enable --user orac`

To see logs:
`journalctl --user -f`

Set your timezone
`timedatectl set-timezone America/Chicago`

Reboot to test that it starts up.

# Configuration

The primary config file seems to be `/etc/mycroft/mycroft.conf`
See here for all the defaults and what you can change them to, since the file only has "differences" in it:
https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-config/blob/dev/ovos_config/mycroft.conf
Edit it and:
 - Add this near the top:
   "system_unit": "imperial",
   - To get Fahrenheit instead of Celsius temp display and spoken.
   - Note that the example site above is WRONG, suggesting to use "english".
 - 

You can set the log level to "DEBUG" to see a lot more info about what files are written and read.

Mostly instead of `mycroft-` tools use `ovos-` tools.

# Package updating for the Insane

I'm not suggesting this is a good idea, but you can force all the Python packages to update,
and force pip to use the latest code from GitHub for OVOS by doing this:

 - Be root
sudo su -

 - Update all OS packages:
pacman -Syu

 - Update pip
/usr/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
 - Update setuptools, as it is often out of date and breaks things
pip install --upgrade setuptools
 - Use the unpinned requirements file to force everything to install with latest versions possible
pip install --upgrade -r /home/ovos/Orac/ovos-setup-stuff/requirements-unpinned.txt

Now reboot, because Ovos needs to start over.

Now you shouldn't see a lot of out of date packages when you run:

pip list --outdated

and the few that are probably are a result of some dependency of other packages in the list.

If you want to know WHY something is still old, run:
pip show <package>

It will show what is requiring it, and then you can look in that package's requirements.txt file to see what version it wants.

If something is listed as old, but just isn't in requirements-unpinned.txt, you can add it, and it should update if you run the pip ... --upgarde command again.

FYI: This file started when I had a corrupt system and had to do a force reinstall of all packages:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt
(Don't do this now.)

# Run Dashboard
TL;DR: It doesn't work, even after you fix it up.

Update the Dashboard
```
cd /usr/local/share
rm -rf ovos-dashboard
git clone https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/OVOS-Dashboard.git
```

```
export PYTHON_SYS_SITE_PACKAGES=/usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages
export PYTHON_USER_SITE_PACKAGES=/home/ovos/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages
export MYCROFT_SKILLS_LOCATION=/home/ovos/.config/mycroft/skills
```
